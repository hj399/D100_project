## Overview

This project uses machine learning and data analysis techniques to explore and predict [brief description of target/goal]. It includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Model training (e.g., GLM, LGBM)  
- Model evaluation and interpretability using SHAP, PDPs, and other tools  
- Visualizations for insights  

---

## Installation Instructions

To set up and run this project, follow the steps below.

---

### 1. **Environment Setup**

Make sure **Conda** is installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and create the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a virtual environment named `data_project` (as defined in `environment.yml`).

---

### 2. **Activate the Environment**

Activate the environment to start using it:

```bash
conda activate data_project
```

---

### 3. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**

To maintain code quality and formatting, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

---

### 4. **Install the Project**

Install the project as an editable package with pip:

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

---

### 5. **Verify the Installation**

To verify that the environment is set up correctly, check the installed packages:

```bash
conda list
```

You should see all required dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `lightgbm`, `dalex`, `shap`, etc.).

---

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can run scripts, notebooks, and other components of the project.

### Example: Running the Analysis

- **Run Python Scripts**:  
   ```bash
   python scripts/your_script_name.py
   ```

- **Launch Jupyter Notebooks**:  
   If the project contains Jupyter notebooks, run:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

- **Run Tests**:  
   If tests are configured:  
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
